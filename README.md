Ive stripped down the code for GameTiger (https://github.com/codetiger/GameTiger-Console) open source handheld game console for pico to use the pico res 2.8 lcd screen, an add on Funduino Joystick shield and pico board. I liked the speed, organisation of the c++ code and versitility of this project so Im going to use bits of it to run my setup as the input/output of pico projects. Im using a double pico extender board to plug in the pico, screen and joystick interface board for development purposes with the idea of adding another pico via i2c, spi or serial addin more cpu and memory.
